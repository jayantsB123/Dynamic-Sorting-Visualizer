Sorting Visualizer: Visualising and Investigating Algorithms
![Uploading Screenshot (150).pngâ€¦]()

A powerful tool that offers an interactive and graphical representation of several sorting methods is a sorting visualizer. 
It provides a simple approach to comprehend and contrast the operation of various sorting techniques, assisting users in understanding the fundamental ideas and effectiveness of each algorithm. Students, programmers, and fans all use this educational resource to better grasp sorting strategies.

Features and Benefits:-

~Demonstration of an algorithm:- Users can view the step-by-step operation of sorting algorithms using sorting visualizers. 
They give insight into the logic and workings of algorithms by visualising the process of moving items around in a list to obtain a particular order.

~Live-Action Animation: The real-time animation of data in sorting visualizers is one of the key benefits algorithms for sorting. 
Users may watch as elements move around the array, switch positions, and gradually arrange themselves into the proper order.

~Comparative Analysis: Sorting visualizers frequently allow users to side-by-side compare various sorting algorithms. 
Users can then choose the sorting technique that is best for a certain task by seeing the variations in execution speed, the quantity of comparisons, and algorithm switches.

~Custom Input: Users are frequently given the option to supply their own arrays or lists to be sorted, allowing them to test out different input sizes and distributions. 
Users may better grasp how different inputs affect the performance of different sorting algorithms thanks to this practical approach.

~Speed Control: Most visualizers let users change the animation's speed. Process slowed down is beneficial.
